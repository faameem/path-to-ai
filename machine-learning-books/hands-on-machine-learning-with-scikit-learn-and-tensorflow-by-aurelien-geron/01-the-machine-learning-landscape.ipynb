    "## Introduction ##\n",
    "* This chapter introduces a lot of fundamental concepts (and jargon) that every data scientist should know by heart. It will be a high-level overview (the only chapter without much code), all rather simple, but you should make sure everything is crystal-clear to you before continuing to the rest of the book. So grab a coffee and let’s get started!\n",

    "## What is Machine Learning ##\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.\n",
    "* Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel, 1959)\n",
    "* A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. (Tom Mitchell, 1997)\n",

    "> **Example:** Spam Filter.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Task:** Correctly identify spam.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Experience:** Training data (collection of emails) + algorithms (machine learning) = model\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Performance:** Ratio of correctly classified emails as spam.\n",

    "## Why Use Machine Learning? ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is great for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better.\n",
    "    > * For example: Spam Filter.\n",
    "    > * Traditional approach: Write a rule based system ('4U', 'cre%it car%'). But as spammers become smarter (using 'ForU' instead of '4U'), the rules list will keep growing and quickly get unweildy.\n",
    "    > * Machine learning approach will keep learning as new training data is fed to the algorithm.\n",
    "* Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional approach: the best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.\n",
    "    > * For example: Speech recognition for words 'one' & 'two'.\n",
    "    > * Traditional rule based approach will be very difficult to even define a good solution.\n",
    "    > * Machine learning approach only needs a good training set of recordings of the words.\n",
    "* Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.\n",
    "* Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.\n",
    "    > * For example: Data mining.\n",
    "    > * Inspect the ML based solution.\n",
    "    > * Understand the problem better.\n",
    "    > * Iterate if needed.\n",

    "## Types of Machine Learning Systems ##\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trained with/without human supervision:\n",
    "    > * Supervised\n",
    "    > * Unsupervised\n",
    "    > * Semisupervised\n",
    "    > * Reinforcement learning\n",
    "2. Can/cannot learn incrementally on the fly:\n",
    "    > * Online learning\n",
    "    > * Batch learning\n",
    "3. Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead detect patterns in the training data and build a predictive model, much like scientists do:                   \n",
    "    > * Instance-based learning\n",
    "    > * Model-based learning\n",
    "4. Example:\n",
    "    > * A state-of-the-art spam filter may learn on the fly using a deep neural network model trained using examples of spam and ham; this makes it an online, model-based, supervised learning system.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Supervised Learning ###\n",
    "\n",
    "* The training data fed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called *labels*.\n",
    "* The training data features/attribute are called *predictors*.\n",
    "* Two types:\n",
    "    1. Classification\n",
    "        > * Training data labels are non-numeric.\n",
    "        > * Example: Spam filter (spam or ham)\n",
    "    2. Regression\n",
    "        > * Training data labels are numeric.\n",
    "        > * Example: Car prices\n",
    "        > * Note that some regression algorithms can be used for classification as well, and vice versa. For example, Logistic Regression is commonly used for classification, as it can output a value that corresponds to the probability of belonging to a given class (e.g., 20% chance of being spam).\n",
    "* Important supervised learning algorithms:\n",
    "    > * k-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "    > * Linear Regression\n",
    "    > * Logistic Regression\n",
    "    > * Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n",
    "    > * Decision Trees and Random Forests\n",
    "    > * Neural networks (Some neural network architectures can be unsupervised, such as autoencoders and restricted Boltzmann machines. They can also be semisupervised, such as in deep belief networks and unsupervised pretraining.)\n",
    "    \n",
    " \n",
    "> **_NOTE_**\n",
    "> In Machine Learning an attribute is a data type (e.g., “Mileage”), while a feature has several meanings depending on the context, but generally means an attribute plus its value (e.g., “Mileage = 15,000”). Many people use the words attribute and feature interchangeably, though."
