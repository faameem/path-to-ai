# Scala Test-Driven Development by Gaurav Sood #

### What this book covers ###

* Chapter 1, Hello, TDD!, contains a brief introduction of TDD and Agile process. We discussed the benefits of TDD and how and why it needs to be used.

* Chapter 2, First Test-Driven Application, creates our very first working application using TDD. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a quick win and give a taste of what lies ahead.

* Chapter 3, Clean Code Using ScalaTest, discusses some of the principles of clean code and delves into the ScalaTest framework.

* Chapter 4, Refactor Mercilessly, discusses various refactoring techniques and their benefits. The idea is to build a gradual appreciation of the refactoring process.

* Chapter 5, Another Level of Testing, discusses the concepts of functional testing and behaviour-driven development.

* Chapter 6, Mock Objects and Stubs, takes an in-depth look into the mocking frameworks that can be used with ScalaTest and Specs2 to enable mocking out the dependencies during testing.

* Chapter 7, Property-Based Testing, discusses the techniques of writing tests that are driven from inputs provided in the form of tabular data or that is randomly generated.

* Chapter 8, Scala TDD with Specs2, looks at an alternative testing framework for test-driving Scala code. We also compare ScalaTest and Specs2 so the reader can make an informed choice.

* Chapter 9, Miscellaneous and Emerging Trends in Scala TDD, explores some new techniques, features, and processes that may soon become incorporated into the mainstream application development process.
